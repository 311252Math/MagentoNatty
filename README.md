# NATOBot


The [New Answers to Old Questions](http://stackoverflow.com/tools/new-answers-old-questions) tool helps us to find all the answers added to questions which are more than 60 days old. However the issue with the tool is that it is not real time. There are requests on [Stack Overflow Meta](http://meta.stackoverflow.com) to not only make it [real time](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/312246/make-the-new-answers-to-old-questions-real-time) but also to [enhance the tool](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/319952/enhance-the-new-answers-to-old-questions-moderator-tool) to add more features to it. However these requests have yet not been implemented. 

The NATOBot project aims to not only overcome the *"not real time"* issue but also help those users below 10,000 reputation to help moderate the answers. 

FAQ
---

1. Where can I find the bot?

   The bot is present in the [SOCVFinder room](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/111347/socvfinder). 

2. Why is it so spammy? Aren't there a lot of useless links?

   At the moment, the bot reports all the posts that appear in the New Answers to Old Questions Tool page. Hence there is alot of false positives. Overtime, as the project improves, you might be seeing lesser and lesser of posts. We are really Sorry for the inconvenience caused.
