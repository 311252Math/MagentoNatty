# [Sentinel](http://sentinel.erwaysoftware.com/posts/12219)
 
Sentinel was designed by ArtOfCode and hosted by Undo to provide Natty with a nice front end. 

In Art's own words 

> Sentinel is the web dashboard for Natty. 
> All posts the bot catches are sent to Sentinel, which collects them as a permanent record. 
> The basic features of Sentinel (viewing posts, reasons, etc, as well as the statistics for them) are available to everyone, but you'll need to sign up to access the more advanced features (post search, API access, etc).


### Issues and Feature Requests

The source code of Sentinel is available on [Github](https://github.com/ArtOfCode-/Sentinel). You can raise issues or request new features there.
